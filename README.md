# MORTALITY-PREDICTION
This is my first Internship Project on Deep Learning. This is a challenge of Mortality Prediction whose aim is to predict whether a person survives or dies during his/her stay at the hospital and we managed to get the accuracy of 75.76% in predicting the condition of patients.
